We have Maths every day. It's the science of numbers. People say, Maths is hard. As for me, I don't agree. If you know the tables, it's as easy as ABC. At the lessons we learn to add, divide, multiply and subtract, because everybody uses numbers and Mathematics every day: when we go shopping, plan something, build houses, plant corn and vegetables and so on. As for me, I am good at Maths.8
